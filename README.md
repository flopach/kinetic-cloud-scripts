# Kinetic GMM Cloud Scripts

This is a simple script on how to use the Kinetic GMM API and get data about deployed Cisco gateways (IR829, IR809, IR807, IR1101) into a python script.

Basically the script has two functions:

1. getgateways(): Get information about all the gateways of your organization
2. gatewayconnectivity(): Check proactively if all gateways are connected

## Getting Started

1. Create an API token in the Kinetic Cloud and put the data in the script (check Kinetic documentation)
2. Run the script

## Built With

* Kinetic Gateway Management Module (Kinetic Cloud)
* Paho-MQTT
